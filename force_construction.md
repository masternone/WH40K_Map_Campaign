# Order of Battle

All forces must be assigned to an **Order of Battle**. As the crusade wages on you may have multiple **Order of Battle**s that represent your forces as they spread across the map. If you spend **Requisitions Points** to Increase Supply Limit it is tied to a specific **Order of Battle**.

# Crusade Card

Every unit must have a **Crusade Card**. This is where victory and growth of the unit will be tracked as the crusade wages.
