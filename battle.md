# Battle
All battles are fought using the Crusade missions in the any of the published 9th edition books. Assign rewards and battle scars as described in the Rule book.
If you find yourself with more than one **Order of Battle** at a location preparing for battle you may make a force that combines all units from all of these **Order of Battle**s.

If the controlling player's **Order of Battle** is garrisoned at a location you must reduce your force by 10 Power level fore each level of fortification present.
