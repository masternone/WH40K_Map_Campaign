# Battle
All battles are fought using the Crusade missions in the any of the published 9th edition books. Assign rewards and battle scars as described in the Rule book.
If you find yourself with more than one **Order of Battle** at a location preparing for battle you may make a force that combines all units from all of these **Order of Battle**s.

As the attacker if the defending player's **Order of Battle** is garrisoned at a location you must reduce your force by 10 Power level for each level of fortification present.

If the attacker is the winner the defender may choose to raise any or all Enhancements at the location. If the defender is the winner the attacker may raise one Enhancement. Once all fortifications are raised the attacker takes control of the location. 

As the result of loosing a location, factory, or command pavilion from a battle the player must validate that they control the correct amount of **Order of Battle**s and HQ units. At this time you may reorganize any of your **Order of Battle**s and any excess **Order of Battle**s and HQ units command card will be lost.
